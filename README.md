# Bellevue

**Bellevue** is a full-featured frontend project template for modern single-page applications built on Vue.js and Webpack.

- Demo: [bellevue.netlify.com](https://bellevue.netlify.com/demo)
- Documentation: [eiskis.gitbooks.io/bellevue](https://eiskis.gitbooks.io/bellevue/)
- Source and issues: [github.com/Eiskis/bellevue](https://github.com/Eiskis/bellevue)

Bellevue is based on the official `vuejs-templates/webpack` template, but extends it with many additional tooling features such as preconfigured SCSS support, SVG optimization and compilation, more full-featured linting and centralised configuration.

But while the official template is only a _Hello world_, Bellevue's goal is to set you up with a well-documented, [thought-out application structure](./app/overview.md) with all the patterns you need for building a complex application including routing, state management, persistence, localisation and more (see [feature comparison](./overview/comparison.md)).
